# ** Prework Study Guide **

## Description

This guide is to help track all of the modules learnt  while undertaking the prework for the Front End Web Developer course.

- I have always had a love and passion for anything coding but now I have the chance for a structured learning and career.
- As part of my working through a structured course to gain certification and to build a solid portfolio I have cleared out all my old and pointless repo's and started again with up to date projects, Here is my first basic but powerful code project.
- This code sameple demonstrates even using basic coding that a powerful and useful application to track my personal progress join the early stages of the course and leaves plenty of opening for further upgrades of the code base to make this so much better and so much more.
- The use of of synaptic HTML and CSS combined with some basic JavaScript can still be powerful.

## Installation

Giving the simplicity of the nature to this code base the instalation is equally simple,
you can either clone the repo and work with it from there or directly copy and paste 3 code files into your own IDE then open the image file in the assestes directory and save it to your own local enviroment.
the directory stucture for this project is:
                                            root directory
                                                        index.html
                                                /assets
                                                        bowtie-cat.png
                                                        script.js
                                                        style.css

## Usage

To use this simple project is as simple as it's design,
open the index.html in a IDE scroll down to the first tag <section> the label of this section is in the <h2> then edit the contents in the <li> to change the list to fit your needs.
If you wish to change the style and colours of the layout then you will need to edit the style.CSS file, also remember if you change the HTML tags or class of any of the elements then you will also need to change the same information inside the style.css otherwise the code breaks.
